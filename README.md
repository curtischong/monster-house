# monster-house

planning:
- I want to host localstack on docker
  - I'll use s3 to store the images
  - I have to build an s3 client
  
I want to test that uploading and everything works
  - upload to localstack and see if permissions work and everything

The question: command line or webui

if webui, it'll be a react app communicating with the backend
  - I can setup graphql but I'm lazy
  - Just rest is enough

  docker pull localstack/localstack
